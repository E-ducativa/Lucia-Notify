Lucia Notify is a tool that will notify you in case a Bugzilla bug changes its status. In the event that your tester friend or person in charge changes the status in Bugzilla, you will not have to wait to enter the page and review, Sister Lucia will do it for you.

## Analogy

Lucia, a nun from the town, had a special gift. Every day in church, she asked God to reveal important changes in people's lives. She kept a book and wrote down divine messages, which were sometimes good and sometimes bad.
The people trusted Luc√≠a, knowing that she would share the news with them, whether happy or sad. Her gift strengthened the community, uniting everyone in times of celebration and support in difficult times.
Lucia, the divine messenger, continued to be a beacon of hope in the town, bringing comfort and joy, no matter what message God sent her.
